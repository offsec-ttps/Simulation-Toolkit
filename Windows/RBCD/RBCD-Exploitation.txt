The following permission types are interesting from an attackers perspective: 

    WriteDACL – modify object’s ACEs and give attacker full control right over the object 
    GenericAll – full rights to the object (add users to a group or reset user’s password) 
    GenericWrite – update object’s attributes (i.e logon script) 
    WriteOwner – change object owner to attacker controlled user take over the object 

    AllExtendedRights – ability to add user to a group or reset password 
    ForceChangePassword – ability to change user’s password 
    Self (Self-Membership) – ability to add yourself to a group 






Check Privileges:

using powerview
================
ON uSer

Get-ObjectAcl -SamAccountName delegate -ResolveGUIDs | ? {$_.ActiveDirectoryRights -eq "GenericAll"}  


On group

Get-NetGroup "domain admins" -FullData

Get-ObjectAcl -ResolveGUIDs | ? {$_.objectdn -eq "CN=Domain Admins,CN=Users,DC=offense,DC=local"}
