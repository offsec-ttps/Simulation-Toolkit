During the simulation, it was observed that the purpose was to detect successful network logons for a specific list of users.
To test this use case, a query was extracted and modified to focus on a specific user and logon type = 10.
It was found that alerts were detected successfully when these parameters were used.




During the simulation, it was observed that the purpose was to detect connection attempts, both successful and failed, on the Ruler workstation.
To test this use case, the simulation was extended to other devices by changing the device name from dvc=ruler to dvc!=ruler or to the simulation server's device name.
It was found that alerts were detected successfully when the device names were modified.
