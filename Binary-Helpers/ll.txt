Observations:

    When a local user is added or removed from a local or global security group, the user is incorrectly assigned as a MemberName due to improper resolution or translation of the account name.
    After making changes to the parameters below, Splunk alerts were triggered:
        dest_user != "-" was changed to dest_user = "-".
        nt_domain IN ("EUR", "AME") was changed to rc_nt_domain IN ("EUR", "AST", "AME").
    Splunk queries are excluding the detection of improper resolution or translation of the account name, which bypasses the intended detection mechanism for local user creation or removal from security-enabled local, global, or universal groups.

Reason for Failures:

    The system is unable to detect when a local user is added or removed from a security group because the user is incorrectly assigned as a MemberName due to improper resolution or translation of the account name.
    Due to the exclusion of dest_user != "-", Splunk queries are not able to detect the alerts related to local user changes.
